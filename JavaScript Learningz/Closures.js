/* We can get more complicated tho and begin utilizing the power of closures w/ nested functions
 * Here, our inner function has access to both the function it's nested in + the global scope. What's
 * useful though is we can return the inner function and it will save the lexical scope it was defined in.

 * So we'd end up saving the state of z, even after the stack frame for outter() has finished. We would also have
 * the state of y, but that wont really matter, as we can just reference y in the context we define privateMethod() in.
 * What we can't do is directly reference z, that inner defined value from the same context privateMethod() is defined in.
 * Rather, we have to invoke privateMethod(), which was defined to utilize that inner value, z...

 * Thereby emulating a private scope. Inaccesbile from the current scope unless we use a predefined accesor/mutator method.

* Another useful instance of utilizing Closures could come in the following example:
* In this case we are performing some functionality in the returned function, but we have
* a persisted state/object that we are performing these functions on, all due to the closure.

* I think if we wanted, we could even persist the total steps of the thingToMove by creating a
* closure-variable (yeah, I coined that) that keeps track of such a thing for each instance... let' see
* Yep, that's doable. Cool! Closures are a good means to privatizing data, but also seem like a good way of doing
